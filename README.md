### Learning Objectives
---
To allow students to demonstrate the following competencies:
- Functional working knowledge of python using the data analyst workflow
- Jupyter notebook capabilities, file names, folder structure, documentation in comments and markdown, clonable and repeatable
- Ability to move data into pandas and perform data cleansing and manipulation
- Acquire data programmatically from internet resources (within the notebook)
- Create compelling visualizations working the notebook
- Combine multiple datasets into a thoughtful, performative data model
- Ability to store and retrieve data files from local sources
- Creation and committed GitHub repo

### Prompt
---
Perform an analysis on 2022 [Buffalo 311 Data](https://data.buffalony.gov/Quality-of-Life/311-Service-Requests/whkc-e5vr)
#### Possible Areas to Examine
- Types and frequency of tickets
- Seasonality of types of tickets
- Append weather data and evaluate trends
- Append population and evaluate trends
### Project Requirements
---
In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions that demonstrate all the Learning Objectives. The notebook should include:

1. A **working** notebook.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code.
2. Functional and documented data importation. 
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In the comments, describe any assumptions made.
4. Show conclusions with images and explainers in markdown cells.
5. Data saved to files within the project file structure.
### Rubric
---
This project will be evaluated based on the deliverablesâ€™ ability to show unit learning objectives have been met. Feedback will be given for each submission.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**A** | _All Learning Objectives demonstrated._
**B** | _Most Learning Objectives demonstrated._
**C** | _A majority of Learning Objectives demonstrated._
**D** | _A minority of Learning Objectives demonstrated._
**F** | _Few Learning Objectives demonstrated._

### Submission
---
Submission instructions:
- Create a repository in your GitHub account, copy your completed notebook to the submission repo, and share a link. 
  - Do not provide a link to or share your working repos. All materials to be submitted should be in your submission repos.
  - **VERY IMPORTANT** The notebook when submitted must have all cells executed and any output displayed or printed as appropriate. Notebooks with unexecuted cells will not be graded or reviewed.
